* one doesn't have MRS UAV setup
* one doesn't even have an SD card in Raspberry Pi
* one doesn't have PixHawk SD card setup
* 68A-I doesn't have PixHawk setup at all (not even the thermal parameters)

62A-I: calibrated, RC in PX setup, one motor doesn't spin - ESC probably fried
68A-I: no thermal calibration, swapped PixHawk with 62A-I, calibrated, RC in PX setup, manual OK, autonomous OK
68B-I: calibrated, RC in PX setup, manual OK, autonomous OK
69A-S: calibrated, RC in PX setup, manul OK-ish, autonomous OK
69B-S: calibrated 2x, RC in PX setup, manual OK, autonomous whirpools (1m radius)
